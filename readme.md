CS 219 Project 1

Task: Create a basic 32 bit machine language simulator that can perform addition on two hexadecimal operands which are given to us through a .txt file. The program will take in the information from a .txt file called "Programming-Project-1.txt".

Instructions on how to execute this program: clone the github repository (https://github.com/larsonnicholas/CS219-Project-1.git) and navigate to the file directory, the folder will be called "CS219-Project-1". Once there, simply run "make" in your terminal, then follow up by running "./main" and the program will execute.
